    <p>London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom. It stands on
       the River Thames in south-east England at the head of a 50-mile (80 km) estuary
        down to the North Sea, and has been a major settlement for two millennia.[9] The
         City of London, its ancient core and financial centre, was founded by the Romans 
         as Londinium and retains boundaries close to its medieval ones.[note 1][10][11] 
         Since the 19th century,[12] "London" has also referred to the metropolis around this core,
          historically split between the counties of Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire,[13]
           which largely makes up Greater London,[14] the region governed by the Greater London Authority.
           [note 2][15] The City of Westminster, to the west of the City, has for centuries held the national
            government and parliament.</p>
